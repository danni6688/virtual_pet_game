# 🐾 Virtual Pet Companion

This project is a simple Python-based simulation where you can adopt and take care of a virtual pet. 
You can name your pet, choose its species, and interact with it in various ways — feeding, playing, resting, cleaning, chatting, and more.

The game includes several built-in features to enhance engagement:
- 🔁 A smart **time progression system** that advances after several actions instead of every move.
- 💾 A flexible **save and load system** that supports custom filenames, allowing multiple pets to be managed separately.
- 🎂 Birthday surprises and unexpected random events to keep gameplay dynamic.
- 🧮 Status attributes such as hunger, energy, cleanliness, and happiness that change based on how you care for the pet.

If your pet's status drops too low, it may sadly run away — so take care!

## 🔧 How to Play
To run the game, make sure you have Python installed, and simply run:

```
python pet.py
